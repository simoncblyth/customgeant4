rsync_put.sh 
===================

When the GFW blocks bitbucket and github "put" from remote using rsync 

Usage::

   ~/customgeant4/rsync_put.sh

HMM : how dodgy a thing is this ? 

* it means a git binary version is having to deal with the raw 
  repo files provide by another version 


* TODO : add cmd that just syncs working copy 


rsync options
----------------

-z, --compress   compress file data during the transfer
-a, --archive    archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)   
-r, --recursive  recurse into directories
-v, --verbose    increase verbosity
    --delete     delete extraneous files from dest dirs

* :google:`rsync git repository`

* https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2020/09/22/migrating-git-data-with-rsync/

::

    "The moral of the story here is to never omit --delete from rsync if youâ€™re
    trying to keep repos in sync."


git bundle
-----------

Another approach see "git help bundle"


observations
----------------

* Doing almost nothing sync takes about 20s
* use of "--delete" is a bit fraught, so this script
  is deliberately not very flexible to avoid surprises
